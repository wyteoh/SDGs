    <h1 class="first" >Current Status and Causes of Food Waste</h1>
        <h3>Global Status: </h3>
        
        <p>About one-third of all food produced globally, approximately 1.3 billion tons, is wasted each year.
        In developed countries, most waste occurs at retail and consumption stages, while in developing countries, waste primarily happens during production and transportation.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Local Status (e.g., China):</h3>
        <p><img class="yyds" src="image/R.jpg" alt="">
        Approximately 35 million tons of food are wasted annually in China, with significant waste in the foodservice sector. 
        <br>
        In rural areas, inadequate storage and transportation facilities lead to substantial post-harvest losses. 
        </p><br>
        <h3>Main Causes:</h3>
        <p>Production Stage: Poor planning, natural disasters, mechanical inefficiencies.
        <br>
        Transportation Stage: Lack of cold chain systems and improper packaging or storage conditions.
        <br>
        Retail Stage: Food discarded due to aesthetic standards or expiration dates.
        <br>
        Consumption Stage: Over-ordering, over-purchasing, and improper food storage by consumers.
